# 📦 batch-install-and-push

A small CLI toolkit to **bulk install or remove npm packages** and **execute any shell command** across multiple local repositories.

This repo contains two scripts with clear responsibilities:

- `sync.js` — fetches remote refs and pulls a branch **only if that branch already exists locally**. It does **not** create branches. Use it to refresh remote refs/branches.
- `batch/batch.js` — the main workflow: ensures the expected branch exists locally (creates it from `origin/<branch>` or falls back to `origin/main` / `main`), runs installs/removals, commits, and optionally pushes.

---

## 🚀 Key differences (important)

- `sync.js` will **never** create a new local branch. It only updates remote refs and pulls if the branch is already checked out locally. This is by design.
- `batch/batch.js` is responsible for creating the local branch (if missing) before performing package changes and pushing.
- Both scripts support `--only` to limit work to a subset of repos listed in `repos.json`.

---

## ✅ Features

- Bulk install or remove packages in many repos
- `--only` to target specific repositories (comma-separated list matching `name` or `path` in `repos.json`)
- `batch/batch.js` will create a local branch when missing:

  - prefer `origin/<branch>` → create a tracking local branch
  - else create locally from the **base branch** (default `origin/main`)

- Configurable base branch via `--base-branch`, `repos.json` `baseBranch`, or per-repo `baseBranch`

- `--dry-run` shows what would be executed without changing repositories
- `--skip-push` for disabling remote pushes when running `batch/batch.js`
- `--verbose` prints command output to the terminal
- Optional parallel execution with a concurrency limit (defaults to sequential unless `--parallel` is provided)
- Per-repo logs are written to `./logs/` (see `processRepo.js` behavior)

## 🧾 `repos.json` format

```json
{
  "basePath": "/Users/<you>/Projects/",
  "baseBranch": "origin/main",
  "repositories": [
    { "name": "web-app1", "branch": "chore/test" },
    { "name": "web-app2", "branch": "fix/bug", "baseBranch": "develop" }
  ]
}
```

- `basePath` — root folder where your local repos live
- `baseBranch` — branch new branches are created from, for **all** repos (default: `origin/main`)
- `name` — folder name or identifier for the repo (used by `--only`)
- `branch` — the branch `batch/batch.js` should create/use for the change
- optional per-repo `baseBranch` overrides the top-level one for that repo
- optional per-repo `remote` may be used if you have a non-`origin` remote configured

### Base branch resolution

Resolved in this order, first match wins:

1. `--base-branch <name>` (CLI flag)
2. `baseBranch` on the repo entry
3. `baseBranch` at the top level of `repos.json`
4. `origin/main` (default)

The remote prefix is optional — `main` and `origin/main` are equivalent, and
branch names containing slashes (`release/1.0`) are preserved. If a repo defines
`remote`, the base branch and the push both use it instead of `origin`.

---

## 🖥️ Usage

Run from the folder where these scripts and `repos.json` live.

**Quick start:** Use the npm scripts for convenience:
- `pnpm batch` (or `npm run batch`) for batch operations
- `pnpm sync` (or `npm run sync`) for sync operations

Alternatively, run directly:
- `node batch/batch.js` for batch operations
- `node sync.js` for sync operations

### Sync (fetch remote refs; do not create branches)

```bash
# fetch refs for a single repo and attempt pull only if branch exists locally
pnpm sync --only=web-app1 --branch=main --verbose

# fetch refs for all repos listed in repos.json (default branch = main)
pnpm sync --parallel --verbose
```

### Batch (create branch if needed, install/remove, commit, push)

```bash
# Install packages in all repos
pnpm batch install lodash dayjs

# Remove packages in a subset of repos
pnpm batch remove lodash --only=web-app1,web-app2

# Aliases
pnpm batch i axios
pnpm batch rm react-query
```

### Exec (run any shell command in all repos)

```bash
# Run any shell command across all repos
pnpm batch exec "git status"

# Create GitHub PRs across repos (great after batch package changes)
pnpm batch exec "gh pr create --title 'feat: update dependencies' --base main"

# Run commands in specific repos only
pnpm batch exec "npm outdated" --only=web-app1,web-app2

# Check for uncommitted changes
pnpm batch exec "git diff --stat" --parallel --verbose
```

### Examples with useful flags

```bash
# Dry run: see what would be done
pnpm batch install lodash --dry-run --only=web-app1

# Verbose with parallel execution (concurrency controlled internally)
pnpm batch install lodash dayjs --parallel --verbose

# Create branch and push (skip push if you only want to commit locally)
pnpm batch install lodash --verbose
pnpm batch install lodash --skip-push

# Branch off something other than origin/main for every repo in this run
pnpm batch install lodash --base-branch=develop
pnpm batch install lodash --base-branch=origin/release/1.0 --dry-run

# Execute shell commands with dry run
pnpm batch exec "gh pr create --title 'fix: analytics'" --dry-run
```

## 📝 Logs & summary

- `processRepo.js` writes per-repo logs into `./logs/<repo>.log`.
- At the end of `batch.js` execution a summary table lists each repo and its status (success / failure) and a short message.

---

## ⚠️ Important notes

- `sync.js` intentionally does not create local branches. Use it for non-invasive remote refs updates and pulls.
- `batch/batch.js` will create local branches when needed (see behavior above). If you prefer to create branches manually, set the branch locally before running `batch/batch.js`.
- The base branch must exist on the remote. If `origin/<baseBranch>` can't be found after fetching, that repo is reported as failed and left untouched — useful when a repo still uses `master` and needs a per-repo `baseBranch`.
- If authentication to remotes fails (SSH keys, tokens), `git fetch`/`pull` will error — run with `--verbose` to see full stderr and fix credentials.
